     <p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.A full stack developer is one who can single-handedly implement both the front-end and back-end workflows, like placing the order or changing the user profile.</p>
     <p>Full stack development provides a faster and more efficient development experience to build web applications, as team members are equipped with the knowledge of various technologies and tools and can use their diverse knowledge for development as well as future research. The two most popular technology stacks‚Äîi.e., MEAN stack and MERN stack‚Äîuse MongoDB as their core database, which has a flexible schema and provides scalability and high availability for any project size.</p>
